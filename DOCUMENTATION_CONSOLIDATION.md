# Documentation Consolidation Notice

**?? Date**: January 2025  
**?? Action**: Documentation Consolidation Completed

## What Was Done

All redundant README files have been **merged into the main README.md** to create a single, comprehensive source of truth for the project documentation.

### Files Consolidated

The following files have been merged into **README.md**:

1. **README_REFACTORING.md** ? Refactoring section in main README
2. **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** ? Project Structure section in main README  
3. **PROJECT_EVALUATION.md** ? Development Status section in main README
4. **README_FAIRINO_SDK.md** ? Hardware Requirements section in main README

### What This Means

- ? **Single Source of Truth**: All project information is now in README.md
- ? **No More Duplicates**: Eliminated redundant and conflicting information
- ? **Better Navigation**: Comprehensive table of contents and organized sections
- ? **Up-to-Date Content**: Latest status and accurate information consolidated
- ? **Easier Maintenance**: Only one file to keep updated

### For Developers

**Use README.md as your primary reference.** It now contains:

- Complete project overview and status
- Installation and setup instructions  
- Hardware and software requirements
- Development roadmap and contribution guidelines
- Refactoring documentation and migration guides
- System architecture and component details
